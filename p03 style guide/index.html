    <h4> About Me <h4/>
    <p>
I am a second-year student in Simon Fraser University, and this is my first year in SIAT. I was major in environmental science at my first year, however, I felt exhausted and bored when I took environmental courses. I felt SIAT is the program that I really want to get in after I taking several IAT courses. I am an international student from China, after finishing my 10th grade in China, I came to Vancouver to continue my high school. My personality is like a cat, shy, do not talk much and I love to be alone, I choose this picture to represent me because I enjoy seeing ocean, and it inspires me a lot.

    <h3> Project 1 <h3/>
    <p>
      In this IAT writing course, I am asked to write a research paper within the domain of new media and global culture. Since my special background, I decided my topic on abortion in China, media channels are seen as a dominant way to advertise abortion. In my essay, I want to convince the audience that abortion in China should be regulated, at least, it should not show on Television, newspaper, or even on social medias to broadcast it. It is affecting teenagers, or mislead them to make decisions that they may regret in the rest of their life. I analysis this topic focus on the concepts of heterotopia and glocalization.
  For this assignment, I am not able to show my argument clearly, my arguments and content are inconsistent at the first place, and I was having a difficult time to finding academic resources to back up my thesis. It is also difficult to explain this special culture in China to my peers since we all have different background. After talking to my TA, I outlined the areas that I want to use to prove my thesis statement, and go find academic resources in SFU library that I can use to prove my point. Therefore, I am able to create an academic research paper to illustrate my writing skills and understanding of the concept.
