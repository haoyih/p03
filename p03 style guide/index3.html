            <h4>IAT222 Interactive Arts:</h4>
            <p class="paragraphs">In this class, we as a team are asked to produce a work of interactive arts. This work
            will be displayed at SIAT,
            and it has to reflect artist practice in at least one area of studied in class.
                First step: as a group, we signed a team contract. We made rules within the team,
                for example, what will we do if one team member missed a meeting, or missed a
                presentation.
 </p>
 <h4>Second step:</h4>
 <p class="paragraphs">  The team had to determine the overall topic for the artwork. Additionally, we had to
   choose a scope which interested all team members while reflecting team inspirations.
   This helped decide our final project goal.<p>
     <h4>Third step:</h4>
     <p class="paragraphs"> We introduced our artwork proposal. First the team decided on a single topic after
       discussing what we wanted to present within the final artwork. Other areas were
       considered, such as how to make the piece work. For instance, utilizing sketches for
       showing how the final piece should appear, ways it could interact with audience members,
       and what type of feeling it should create.<p>
         <h4>Forth/Fifth step:</h4>
         <p class="paragraphs"> The artwork prototype. The team
         began working and encounter several problems. First, the professor stated our prototype
         was too simple.
         Therefore, we had to discussed and rethink of alternative methods for participants to
         interact with the final artwork.<p>
             Final project in the Gallery. Our final artwork was showcased at SFU. To ensure
             participants understood, we included a description with the final piece. We lacked
             enough gold paper during the final stage,
             therefore, we decided to apply it only on two sides of the box’s interior. Instead
             of four sides.<p>

            <h4>PUB 375:</h4>
            <p class="paragraphs">This is a project from Pub 375, the goal of this project is to build up a
            real magazine through the whole semester, we were working in group of five,
            two of us from IAT program are responsible for design the magazine.
 </p>
 <h4>Step 1:</h4>
 <p class="paragraphs">  The first step of design the real magazine
     is to choose a color palate that is suitable for our magazine’s theme.
     As a group, we decided that the main idea of our magazine is about travel, and
     the mood that tourist have during their journeys.<p>
     <h4>Step 2:</h4>
     <p class="paragraphs"> As the design group of this project,
         the second step is to design a tittle for the magazine.
         Since our magazine is about travel, the name we discussed as
         a group is “the resident nomad”. We have created several versions of the tittle
         of magazine, then in our group, we vote for which one is better for the
         magazine.<p>
         <h4>Step 3:</h4>
         <p class="paragraphs"> he third step is to design the cover page
             of our magazine,
             since the cover page is the first thing that people see, so we have to establish
             the mood,
             and the concept for our magazine, We designed three cover pages for the
             magazine, and then as a group, decided on which one we should use for our cover
             page.<p>
               <h4>Step 4:</h4>
               <p class="paragraphs"> As the designer of the group,
            we have to design for the print publication and the
                   web layout for our magazine,
                and also the poster for our launch party.</p>.

            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p class="paragraphs">  This is my second year as a Simon Fraser University student, but the first-year for
              SIAT. During the first year my major was environmental science, but the environmental
              courses had become boring. Therefore, I decided I wanted to take the SIAT program after
              I took various many IAT courses. Originally from China where I completed the 10t grade,
              then relocated to Vancouver where I continued high school. I have a personality similar
              to a cat, I am shy, prefer being alone and not much of a talker. The picture I choose
              for representing me is one that inspires me and incorporates my love for oceans.
      </p>
      <h4>Interest of Emploment:</h4>
      <p class="paragraphs">    I am interested in graphic design job positions, any job that related
        to graphic design is interested. I am familiar with InDesign, AI, and Photoshop. I am
        also a quick learner, anything that I do not learn from school can be learned very
        quickly. I want to find a job that really suits me, and I am a hard worker.<p>
